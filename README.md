# PHIVE - Integrative Validation Engine

[![javadoc](https://javadoc.io/badge2/com.helger.phive/phive-engine/javadoc.svg)](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.helger.phive/phive-engine)
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.helger.phive/phive-parent-pom/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.helger.phive/phive-parent-pom) 

A generic document validation engine originally developed for Peppol but now also supporting many other document types.

The original name was "ph-bdve" but because it was so difficult to pronounce, it was decided to change the name to "phive" which is an abbreviation of "Philip Helger Integrative Validation Engine" and is pronounced exactly like the digit 5: `[ˈfaɪv]`. The old name of the repository was "ph-bdve".

This project only contains the validation **engine** - all the preconfigured rules are available at https://github.com/phax/phive-rules

This project is licensed under the Apache 2 license.

A live version of this engine can be found on [Peppol Practical](http://peppol.helger.com/public/menuitem-validation-upload) and at [ecosio](https://ecosio.com/en/peppol-and-xml-document-validator/).

This project has the following sub-modules:
* **phive-api** - a generic API that is independent of the effective validation logic
* **phive-engine** - the validation engine that assembles all the pieces together and validates documents
* **phive-json** - helper classes to convert validation results from and to JSON

Note: please see [README v5](docs/READMEv5.md) for the v5 documentation and [README v6](docs/READMEv6.md) for the v6 documentation.

# Usage guide

Basically this library wraps different XML Schemas and Schematrons in a certain order and under certain constraints and offers the possibility to validate XML documents based on the rules.

## Validation executor set identification

Every set of validation artefacts is uniquely identified based on a structure that is similar to [Maven coordinates](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Maven_Coordinates). The identifier for a set of validation artefacts is a so called "VESID" ("Validation Executor Set ID"). Each VESID consists of a mandatory group ID, a mandatory artefact ID, a mandatory version number (ideally following the semantic versioning principles) and an optional classifier.
E.g. the "Peppol Invoice Fall release 2018" is identified with the group ID `eu.peppol.bis2`, the artefact ID is `t10` (based on "transaction 10" from CEN BII - historical reasons...), the version number is `3.7.0` (representing "Fall 2018") and no classifier is present.
Another example is "SimplerInvoicing 1.2 invoice" which has the group ID `org.simplerinvoicing`, the artifact ID `invoice` and the version number `1.2` (also without a classifier).

Each VESID can be represented in a single string in the form `groupID:artifiactID:version[:classifier]`. Neither group ID, nor artifact ID, nor version number, nor classifier may contain the colon (':') character, any bracket character ('<' and '>') nor any other character forbidden in filenames in any OS.

## How to validate documents

At least the `phive-engine` project and one library with rule sets (like e.g. `phive-rules-peppol` from https://github.com/phax/phive-rules) is needed in your application. See the section on usage in a Maven project below.
All available VES must be registered in an instance of class `ValidationExecutorSetRegistry` (which can simply created via `new`).
Depending on the used domain specific libraries, initialization calls for registration into the registry must be performed.
Example for registering (only) Peppol validation artefacts:

```java
    final ValidationExecutorSetRegistry <IValidationSourceXML> aVESRegistry = new ValidationExecutorSetRegistry<> ();
    PeppolValidation.initStandard (aVESRegistry);
    return aVESRegistry;
```

The instance of class `ValidationExecutorSetRegistry` can be kept as a (static) singleton - it is thread-safe.
Therefore the registration process need to be performed only once.

Validating a business document requires a few more steps.
1. Access to the registry is needed.
1. A specific `VESID` instance (e.g. `PeppolValidation3_10_0.VID_OPENPEPPOL_INVOICE_V3`) - there are constants available for all VES identifiers defined in this project.
1. The `ValidationExecutionManager` is an in-between class that can be used to customize the execution. But it is created very quickly, so there is no harm on creating it on the fly every time.
1. An instance of class `ValidationSourceXML` to identify the document to be validate. Class `ValidationSourceXML` has factory methods for the default cases (having an `org.w3c.dom.Node` or having an `com.helger.commons.io.resource.IReadableResource`).
1. The validation results are stored in an instance of class `ValidationResultList`. This class is a list of `ValidationResult` instances - each `ValidationResult` represents the result of a single level of validation.
1. Your application logic than needs to define what to do with the results. 


```java
    // Resolve the VES ID
    final IValidationExecutorSet<IValidationSourceXML> aVES = aVESRegistry.getOfID (aVESID);
    if (aVES != null) {
      // Code for 6.x:
      final ValidationExecutionManager<IValidationSourceXML> aVEM = new ValidationExecutionManager<> (aVES);
      // What to validate?
      IValidationSourceXML aValidationSource = ...;
      // Main execution
      final ValidationResultList aValidationResult = aVEM.executeValidation (aValidationSource);
      if (aValidationResult.containsAtLeastOneError ()) {
        // errors found ...
      } else {
        // no errors (but maybe warnings) found
      }                                                                       
    }                                                                             
```

Since v6 you have an easier solution to perform the same:

```java
    // Resolve the VES ID
    final IValidationExecutorSet<IValidationSourceXML> aVES = aVESRegistry.getOfID (aVESID);
    if (aVES != null) {
      // Shortcut introduced in v6
      final ValidationResultList aValidationResult = ValidationExecutionManager.executeValidation (aVES, aValidationSource);
      if (aValidationResult.containsAtLeastOneError ()) {
        // errors found ...
      } else {
        // no errors (but maybe warnings) found
      }                                                                       
    }                                                                             
```

# Maven usage

Add the following to your `pom.xml` to use this artifact, replacing `x.y.z` with the latest version:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.phive</groupId>
  <artifactId>phive-engine</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are interested in the JSON binding you may also include this artefact.  

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.phive</groupId>
  <artifactId>phive-json</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternate usage as a Maven BOM:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.helger.phive</groupId>
  <artifactId>phive-parent-pom</artifactId>
  <version>x.y.z</version>
  <type>pom</type>
  <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Potential issues

Please ensure that your stack size is at least 1MB (for Saxon). Using the Oracle runtime, this can be achieved by passing `-Xss1m` on the command line. This only seems to be a problem when running 32bit Java. With 64bit Java, the default stack size of the Oracle JVM is already 1MB.
